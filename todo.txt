Rtags:
- Determined that rtags needs compile_commands.json, which is generated by cmake.
- In order to generate the compile_commands.json file, you need to run:
    # cmake -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
- Since a lot of projects use make, as opposed to cmake, the compile_commands.json file does not exist.
- There is apparently a wrapper for make called, 'bear': https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear


AwesomeWM:
 - Add battery level to status bar
  - Also, should record battery levels, possibly in rrd, and use it to determine charge/discharge rate.
 - Add IP addresses to status bar
 - Add icons for sound output devices in status bar.
 - Look into pushing notifications to the AWM status bar, as opposed to polling. 
 - Look into modifying the layouts ... In equal aligned, there is a gap..
  - See about three vertical windows...

Sound:
 - Get sound to work. DONE, installed alsa packages.
 - See if plugging in headphones will switch audio device as expected?
   - There is an output for speakers and one for head phones. So... not currently.
 - See if a TRRS mic+headphones will work

Screen:
 - write screen brightness setter (in C), already have one in python
 - possibly use camera to ajust brightness?


Vim:
 - Yank to clipboard? Is this possible?
