Rtags:
- Determined that rtags needs compile_commands.json, which is generated by cmake.
- In order to generate the compile_commands.json file, you need to run:
    # cmake -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
- Since a lot of projects use make, as opposed to cmake, the compile_commands.json file does not exist.
- There is apparently a wrapper for make called, 'bear': https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear

 - Need to walk through the terminal colors as HSV values and drop the V amount for all colors.
