Rtags:
- Determined that rtags needs compile_commands.json, which is generated by cmake.
- In order to generate the compile_commands.json file, you need to run:
    # cmake -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
- Since a lot of projects use make, as opposed to cmake, the compile_commands.json file does not exist.
- There is apparently a wrapper for make called, 'bear': https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear


AwesomeWM:
 - Remove titles from windows. I don't need this.
 - Change themes to use the Solarized colors.
 - Add battery level to status bar
  - Also, should record battery levels, possibly in rrd, and use it to determine charge/discharge rate.
 - Add IP addresses to status bar

Xresources:
 - Look into changing command line colours to Solarized.

Vim:
 - Yank to clipboard? Is this possible?
 

FINISHED!!:
